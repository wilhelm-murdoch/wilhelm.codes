    <h2><a href="/the-longer-something-doesnt-happen-the-sooner-it-will/">The Longer Something Doesn&#39;t Happen, the Sooner it Will.</a></h2>
    <p>This is often referred to as the &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_time_between_failures">Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)</a>&rdquo; in the context of Site Reliability Engineering. It&rsquo;s a somewhat counterintuitive concept that highlights the fact that failures or incidents tend to occur when you least expect them, especially if you haven&rsquo;t experienced one for a while.</p>
<p>While it may sound paradoxical, there is some reasoning behind it.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/why-i-built-plant-smart/">Why I Built Plant Smart</a></h2>
    <p>Simply put, I love plants and I love animals. I can&rsquo;t count how many times I&rsquo;ve been to a plant nursery and had to stop and do a Google search to see if something was safe enough to bring home and keep around our little Pandora, or üêº for short.</p>

<h3 id="its-as-simple-as-that"><strong>It&rsquo;s as simple as that?</strong></h3>
<p>That was the idea, at least. I just wanted a single place that had all the information I needed so I could make informed purchasing decisions. I also figured I couldn&rsquo;t possibly be the only person who has this problem. So, I set off to make this project during the holiday break of 2022.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/save-money-by-keeping-your-aws-account-clean/">Save Money By Keeping Your AWS Account Clean</a></h2>
    <p>At my current role, we manage just under 20 AWS accounts. Their uses vary from production workloads, to dedicated CI/CD environments, sandboxed areas for our engineers to experiment in, log aggregation, the list goes on. Needless to say, we like to isolate our concerns across our AWS org.</p>
<p>Because we have so many to manage and not a whole lot of people power ( it‚Äôs just 2 of us ), it gets easy for a lot of hidden costs to pop up here and there if we aren‚Äôt vigilant enough with housekeeping.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/deleting-massive-s3-buckets-the-easy-way/">Deleting Massive S3 Buckets the Easy Way.</a></h2>
    <h2 id="ok-">Ok&hellip; ü•±</h2>
<p>Right, so, I&rsquo;m in the middle of decommissioning a service at the moment and I have to do the typical process of performing final snapshots and cleaning up extant resources.</p>
<p>For this particular service, we have an  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL</a>  process that stores raw data points for downstream ingestion by some other&hellip; thing. Anyway, the storage mechanism for this is a cross-region replicated S3 bucket containing just over 10 <em>million</em> objects.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/messing-around-with-txt-records/">Messing Around with TXT Records!</a></h2>
    <h2 id="hey-wanna-see-a-neat-trick-">Hey, wanna see a neat trick? ü§Ø</h2>
<p>Open up your terminal of choice and invoke this <code>dig</code> command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>dig txt contact.wilhelm.codes +short
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You should see, hopefully ü§û, the following block of text as a response:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;twitter: @wilhelm&#34;

<p>Simply put, you&rsquo;re looking at my contact details using a simple DNS <code>TXT</code> record lookup. There are <a href="https://dns.google/query?name=contact.wilhelm.codes">heaps</a> <a href="https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/">of</a> <a href="https://www.diggui.com/">online tools</a> out there to help you directly query DNS records, but <code>dig</code> tends to be the most common utility included included in most Linux distributions as well as MacOS.</p>
