In my demo I created the actual secret for demo purposes). The CRD controller then creates a secret in the background when processing the CRD (e.g. the CRD is a \"cluster\" resource and the controller adds the secret for the kubeconfig). If this secret contains data that a provider should use, the secret data source of the Kubernetes provider can be helpful. After successful read, the provider can be configured and used (in this case also the Kubernetes provider for demo purposes).\n\nI would expect that using a data source in a provider configuration works and would result in resources than can be planned only during apply or something like that? I'm not quite in the Tofu code, maybe thats possible, if not I am open to further suggestions.\n\nMaybe this could be solved with fallback for data sources (see #2443) but I think its not the best solution for this.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThis will work for the first apply. For any further applys or plans where something changes in the CRD (in my case I just added a label to the secret in the kubernetes_manifest resource), this no longer works because the data source can now only be read at runtime (because of the `depends_on`). The provider will use the default values (in case of the kubernetes provider its \"localhost:443\") which wont work.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. `tofu init`\n2. `tofu apply` (works on first apply)\n3. Change something in the first resource so that the data source must be re-read (e.g. add a label)\n4. `tofu plan` (fails because provider is not configured)\n\n### Additional Context\n\nThis was discussed initially in #2443, but I think this is an issue on its own but maybe this can be \"solved\" with the idea of fallback for data sources suggest in the issue. But I think the better way of solving this is to adjust how the plan of such resources works. \n\n### References\n\n- #2443 ",

I'm more interested in solving the problem that providers based on data sources work on the first apply and not on applies after that, if the data source is re-read. This is probably a different / new issue, I just thought that this could be solved by fallback to a last read state (as suggested here). Or the plan logic for such resources should not try to plan them if the provider is not yet fully \"defined\" (because the provider \"definition data\" comes from a data source that is read during apply).\n\nReading this again, this is probably an issue of its own.",

        "body": "Thank you @apparentlymart and @simonostendorf for the comments and taking the time to read through the feature request.\n\n---\n\n## Handling of Different Error Types\n\n> [...]\n> With the protocol as it currently exists, the closest we could get to meeting this proposal would be to \"fallback from state\" on any error whatsoever.\n\nYes I thought so, thanks for clarifying.\n\nIt might not be desirable to always fallback to the last state if an error occurs. For example if the underlying provider does not find a given requested resource it is expected to return an error and fail the plan/apply. Falling back to the last successful state in this case could cause confusion and might not be intended.\n\nI see a few ways this could be handled:\n\n### Error Filter Pattern\n\nWe could try to determine the kind of failure from the error message by looking at specific keywords like \"not found\" and allow to set those with an `error_filter_pattern` as part of the `lifecycle -> fallback` hook.\n\n```hcl\ndata \"aws_ami\" \"example\" {\n  id = var.aws_ami_id\n\n  lifecycle {\n    fallback {\n\t\tenabled = true\n   \t \terror_filter_pattern = [\"5[0-9]{2}|timeout\"]\n\t}\n  }\n}\n``` \n\nThis would bypass the need to extend the provider interface while still allowing the user of the data source to configure the cases where they want to fallback.\n\n### Circuit Breaker\n\nIn addition or as its own feature we could add a \"circuit breaker\" like pattern into the reading of data sources.\nEvery time a fallback was triggered and the apply succeeded the circuit breaker count is increased by one. On a configurable threshold the circuit breaker flips open and the reading of the data source fails. Once triggered it can only be closed again if the data source read was successful and an successful apply happened, thus valid new state was written. The counter would reset to 0 on every successful apply of the data source.\n\n```hcl\ndata \"aws_ami\" \"example\" {\n  id = var.aws_ami_id\n\n  lifecycle {\n    fallback {\n\t\tenabled = true\n   \t \tmax_failures = 3 # default\n\t}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Fallback in Case of Schema Upgrades\n\n> Your proposal would effectively cause the same situation to arise as part of the main plan/apply workflow, and so we'd need to define what ought to happen if the provider's ReadDataSource function returns an error and the prior state contains data that doesn't conform to the current provider schema.\n\nI would say that in this case we could simply fail and have the error from the `ReadDataSource` passed through together with an additional warning message giving a reasoning to the user why the fallback was not triggered.\n\nAnother option I could see is that we can provide one of the following additional arguments to the `fallback` lifecycle:\n\n- `unsafe_ignore_schema_changes = true` - always returns the last state and completely ignores schema changes then refreshes the state when the provider is called successfully the next time.\n- `return_null_on_schema_changes = true` - returns `null` for the data source in case of a schema change.\n\nWe could also introduce an enum and different strategies for handling those cases making it more flexible:\n\n```hcl\ndata \"aws_ami\" \"example\" {\n  id = var.aws_ami_id\n\n  lifecycle {\n    fallback {\n\t\tenabled = true\n   \t \tschema_upgrade_stategy = RETRY|IGNORE|RETURN_NULL|FAIL(default)\n\t}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n@simonostendorf if I understand your use-case correctly you pretty much want to always fallback to the first and only state of the data source as it will never again come back \"online\"?\n\nIf this is correct it might make sense to not have something like a strategy for the overall fallback as well?\n\n```hcl\n[...]\ndata \"kubernetes_secret_v1\" \"crd_secret\" {\n  metadata {\n    name = \"my-secret\"\n    namespace = \"default\"\n  }\n  depends_on = [\n    kubernetes_manifest.crd\n  ]\n  lifecycle {\n    fallback {\n      enabled = true\n      strategy = ALWAYS|RETRY|CIRCUIT_BREAKER|ONCE\n    }\n  }\n}\n[...]\n```\n\n---\n\nThank you all for your thoughts and the great discussion!",

They must all pass for the\r\n  # value to be considered valid.)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat design has worked well for simple primitive-typed variables, but it's annoying for variables of collection types because in that case we typically want to apply a validation rule to each element and then mention in the error messages exactly which elements were invalid, which requires both a complicated `condition` expression _and_ a very similar complicated `error_message` expression to repeat essentially the same steps to find out which elements were invalid:\r\n\r\n```hcl\r\nvariable \"ami_ids\" {\r\n  type = set(string)\r\n\r\n  validation {\r\n    condition = alltrue([\r\n      for id in var.ami_ids : startswith(id, \"ami-\")\r\n    ])\r\n    error_message = \"Invalid AMI IDs: ${join(\", \", [\r\n        for id in var.ami_ids : id if !startswith(id, \"ami-\")\r\n    ])}.\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change is a prototype for an optional new alternative where the block contains only a single argument `error_messages` that deals with both the condition and the error message generation at the same time. Its expression must return a list of strings where an empty list represents \"valid\" and a non-empty list represents \"invalid\". In the invalid case, each element is returned as a separate error diagnostic.\r\n\r\nThis means that module authors can use a \"for\" expression with an \"if\" clause to filter out all of the valid elements and to project any invalid elements into an error messages describing what is wrong with them. For example:\r\n\r\n```hcl\r\nvariable \"ami_ids\" {\r\n  type = set(string)\r\n\r\n  validation {\r\n    error_messages = [\r\n      for id in var.ami_ids : format(\"Invalid AMI ID %q: must have \\\"ami-\\\" prefix.\", id)\r\n      if !startswith(id, \"ami-\")\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n  # (multiple validation blocks are still allowed, and each one\r\n  # can decide between condition+error_message or error_messages\r\n  # as appropriate for what they are checking.)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn principle this could also be used with new provider-defined functions that are designed to take a value and return a list of problems with that value, such as in a hypothetical provider that implements JSON schema-based validation of a data structure using an externally-provided schema, as described in https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/2417#issuecomment-2611055522.\r\n\r\nThis is only a prototype so the test coverage is rudimentary and it only currently works for input variable validation. If we decide that we'd like to implement something like this for real then we'll want to extend it to work for all of the other kinds of checks -- test assertions, \"check\" block assertions, and preconditions/postconditions -- since the language design intent is for those to all appear to have essentially the same treatment, despite not all of the code currently being shared between them.\r\n",

        "body": "While I like that this makes nice use of existing language features like `for` expressions instead of inventing an entirely new way of writing a projection from value to error messages, it is a notable quirk that this new orientation requires writing an expression for which elements are _not_ valid, whereas the current design requires writing an expression for which elements are valid.\r\n\r\nIf only one of those two existed then I think either could be defensible, but having both of them in the language at once could be pretty confusing, and might cause someone to incorrectly adapt a `condition`+`error_message` rule into an `error_messages` rule should an existing input variable switch from being a single value to being a collection of values while wanting to retain the same rule for each value.\r\n",

        "body": "This is a prototype for an idea I discussed in the comments of https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/2417.\r\n\r\nThe original design for check blocks was a boolean argument `condition` which returns true for valid and false for invalid, and then a separate string argument `error_message` whose value is displayed as part of an error diagnostic if the value is found to be invalid:\r\n\r\n```hcl\r\nvariable \"ami_id\" {\r\n  type = string\r\n\r\n  validation {\r\n    condition     = startswith(var.ami_id \"ami-\")\r\n    error_message = \"Must be a valid AMI ID, with the \\\"ami-\\\" prefix.\"\r\n  }\r\n  # (multiple validation blocks are allowed if there are multiple\r\n  # independent rules to check. They must all pass for the\r\n  # value to be considered valid.)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat design has worked well for simple primitive-typed variables, but it's annoying for variables of collection types because in that case we typically want to apply a validation rule to each element and then mention in the error messages exactly which elements were invalid, which requires both a complicated `condition` expression _and_ a very similar complicated `error_message` expression to repeat essentially the same steps to find out which elements were invalid:\r\n\r\n```hcl\r\nvariable \"ami_ids\" {\r\n  type = set(string)\r\n\r\n  validation {\r\n    condition = alltrue([\r\n      for id in var.ami_ids : startswith(id, \"ami-\")\r\n    ])\r\n    error_message = \"Invalid AMI IDs: ${join(\", \", [\r\n        for id in var.ami_ids : id if !startswith(id, \"ami-\")\r\n    ])}.\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change is a prototype for an optional new alternative where the block contains only a single argument `error_messages` that deals with both the condition and the error message generation at the same time. Its expression must return a list of strings where an empty list represents \"valid\" and a non-empty list represents \"invalid\". In the invalid case, each element is returned as a separate error diagnostic.\r\n\r\nThis means that module authors can use a \"for\" expression with an \"if\" clause to filter out all of the valid elements and to project any invalid elements into an error messages describing what is wrong with them. For example:\r\n\r\n```hcl\r\nvariable \"ami_ids\" {\r\n  type = set(string)\r\n\r\n  validation {\r\n    error_messages = [\r\n      for id in var.ami_ids : format(\"Invalid AMI ID %q: must have \\\"ami-\\\" prefix.\", id)\r\n      if !startswith(id, \"ami-\")\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n  # (multiple validation blocks are still allowed, and each one\r\n  # can decide between condition+error_message or error_messages\r\n  # as appropriate for what they are checking.)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn principle this could also be used with new provider-defined functions that are designed to take a value and return a list of problems with that value, such as in a hypothetical provider that implements JSON schema-based validation of a data structure using an externally-provided schema, as described in https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/2417#issuecomment-2611055522.\r\n\r\nThis is only a prototype so the test coverage is rudimentary and it only currently works for input variable validation. If we decide that we'd like to implement something like this for real then we'll want to extend it to work for all of the other kinds of checks -- test assertions, \"check\" block assertions, and preconditions/postconditions -- since the language design intent is for those to all appear to have essentially the same treatment, despite not all of the code currently being shared between them.\r\n",

The error I get upon running a 'tofu plan' is:\n\nPlanning failed. OpenTofu encountered an error while generating this plan.\n\n```\n│ Error: Provider produced invalid plan\n│ \n│ Provider \"provider[\\\"registry.opentofu.org/hashicorp/helm\\\"].by_region[\\\"us-ashburn-1\\\"]\" planned an invalid value for\n│ helm_release.ingress-nginx[\"us-ashburn-1\"].description: planned value cty.StringVal(\"Install complete\") for a non-computed\n│ attribute.\n│ \n│ This is a bug in the provider, which should be reported in the provider's own issue tracker.\n╵\n```\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1: 'tofu init'\n2: 'tofu plan'\n\n### Additional Context\n\nFor this code, I'm pulling in data from an existing Oracle OCI VCN and an existing OKE Kubernetes cluster. I have a for_each loop for the provider that iterates through a map to figure out what regions it should be looking for, although currently it's only a single region. This all works fine, and the helm chart installation works fine. I only get the error if I try to add the looped (for_each) import statement to my code for the helm chart.\n\n### References\n\n_No response_",

        "body": "After writing the above I reviewed [the expectations for a provider's `PlanResourceChange` implementation](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/docs/resource-instance-change-lifecycle.md#planresourcechange) and noticed a detail I'd forgotten (emphasis mine):\n\n> - Any attribute **that was non-null in the configuration** must either preserve the exact configuration value or return the corresponding attribute value from the prior state. (Do the latter if you determine that the change is not functionally significant, such as if the value is a JSON string that has changed only in the positioning of whitespace.)\n\nThe text unfortunately doesn't actually specify what the rule is when the attribute _was_ `null` (or, equivalently, unset) in the configuration, but the overall spirit of these rules is that any value set in the configuration must be preserved identically in the plan unless otherwise stated. Therefore, since `description` isn't set in your configuration (and therefore this special rule does not apply) I think this is most likely a bug in the provider rather than in OpenTofu Core.\n\nI suggest opening a similar report in [the provider's repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-helm) and then we can see how the provider developers react to it and determine whether this _is_ a provider bug or if OpenTofu isn't implementing the provider plugin protocol correctly.\n",

Deployments would grind to a halt and fail because Backstage is down.*\n\n### Attempted Solutions\n\nA localized solution we came up with was to contact the maintainer of the provider and [implement a fallback mechanism](https://github.com/datolabs-io/terraform-provider-backstage/pull/167) that allowed passing in an object matching the expected output. The passed in fallback input, if provided, was then used after a set number of retries and simply returned to the consumer instead of an error.\n\nTo make this really useful we used the [built-in remote state data source](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/state/remote-state-data/) to get the last successful \"snapshot\" of the latest apply and used that as the fallback input.\n\nAs a result we were able to use Backstage as the defacto source of truth for metadata computing always up-to-date labels, causing no drift or failed deployments even if Backstage was to go down.\n\n### Proposal\n\nI think a generalized fallback mechanism for `data sources` to automatically use the last successful snapshot of the configured state backend would be a great and distinguishing feature addition to OpenTofu making it possible to use the above described pattern in any provider without having to \"patch\" it.\n\nOne way I could think of that is is implemented is using the `lifecycle` meta argument of `data sources` and, in its simplest version, add a `fallback_from_state = true/false` option.\nSet to `true` a not reachable or timeout error of the provider will cause the data source to print a warning with the returned error instead and returns the last snapshot from the state.\n\nIf no data exists in the state the error is passed through as an error and fails like usual.\n\n```hcl\ndata \"aws_ami\" \"example\" {\n  id = var.aws_ami_id\n\n  lifecycle {\n    fallback_from_state = true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n*Note: in addition to this a retry, backoff, and resiliency feature for providers in general could also be added to increase the reliability of pipelines and decrease failure rates due to timeouts or throttling.*\n\n### References\n\n- [Blog post about the topic: Fixing Cloud Resource Labeling: Using Backstage Metadata with Terraform](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fixing-cloud-resource-labeling-using-backstage-michael-reichenbach-fviof/)",

        "body": "I have another use case for storing and using the latest version of a data source for providers:\n\nSuppose I have the following sample program (see end), which creates a CRD (in my demo only the actual secret, but I have the initial case of a CRD) with the Kubernetes provider. The CRD controller then creates a secret in the background when processing the CRD. If this secret contains data that a provider should use, the secret data source of the Kubernetes provider can be helpful. After successful import, the provider can be configured and used (in this case also the Kubernetes provider for illustrative purposes).\n\nThis will also work for the first application. For any further apply where something changes in the CRD (in my case I just added a label to the secret in the kubernetes_manifest resource), this no longer works because the data source can now only be read at runtime (see Dependencies). The provider will use the default values (in case of the kubernetes provider its \"localhost:443\") and tries to manage the resources wouldnt help you\n\nSimple example code:\n\n```hcl\nterraform {\n  required_providers {\n    kubernetes = {\n      source  = \"hashicorp/kubernetes\"\n      version = \"~> 2.35\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nprovider \"kubernetes\" {\n  config_path    = \"/home/<path>/kind.kubeconfig\"\n  config_context = \"kind\"\n}\n\n# to show this with easy configuration this is a secret\n# but pretend this is a custom resource definition that has a controller that creates the secret that will be read later\nresource \"kubernetes_manifest\" \"crd\" {\n  manifest = {\n    apiVersion = \"v1\"\n    kind       = \"Secret\"\n    metadata = {\n      name = \"my-secret\"\n      namespace = \"default\"\n      labels = {\n        \"app\" = \"second-apply\"\n      }\n    }\n    data = {\n      host = base64encode(yamldecode(file(\"${path.module}/<path>/kind.kubeconfig\")).clusters[0].cluster[\"server\"])\n      ca_certificate = base64encode(yamldecode(file(\"${path.module}/<path>/kind.kubeconfig\")).clusters[0].cluster[\"certificate-authority-data\"])\n      client_certificate = base64encode(yamldecode(file(\"${path.module}/<path>/kind.kubeconfig\")).users[0].user[\"client-certificate-data\"])\n      client_key = base64encode(yamldecode(file(\"${path.module}/<path>/kind.kubeconfig\")).users[0].user[\"client-key-data\"])\n    }\n  }\n}\n\ndata \"kubernetes_secret_v1\" \"crd_secret\" {\n  metadata {\n    name = \"my-secret\"\n    namespace = \"default\"\n  }\n  depends_on = [\n    kubernetes_manifest.crd\n  ]\n}\n\nprovider \"kubernetes\" {\n  alias = \"second\"\n  host                   = data.kubernetes_secret_v1.crd_secret.data.host\n  cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(data.kubernetes_secret_v1.crd_secret.data.ca_certificate)\n  client_certificate     = base64decode(data.kubernetes_secret_v1.crd_secret.data.client_certificate)\n  client_key             = base64decode(data.kubernetes_secret_v1.crd_secret.data.client_key)\n}\n\nresource \"kubernetes_secret_v1\" \"test\" {\n  provider = kubernetes.second\n  metadata {\n    name = \"test\"\n    namespace = \"default\"\n  }\n  data = {\n    password = \"my-password\"\n  }\n}\n```",

I have a for_each loop for the provider that iterates through a map to figure out what regions it should be looking for, although currently it's only a single region. This all works fine, and the helm chart installation works fine. I only get the error if I try to add the looped (for_each) import statement to my code for the helm chart.\n\n### References\n\n_No response_",

        "body": "Hi @jderieg! Thanks for reporting this.\n\nUnfortunately it seems to me that the error message is correct that this bug belongs to the `hashicorp/helm` provider rather than to OpenTofu itself.\n\nThe provider's schema [declares `description` as \"optional\" but not \"computed\"](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-helm/blob/420fb40f1ed2a1a0f11faa668d02d23a1ca820f1/helm/resource_helm_release.go#L281-L287), which means that the provider is telling OpenTofu that your configuration is the authority on what this attribute is set to but that you're allowed to leave it unset.\n\nYour configuration for `helm_release.ingress-nginx` does not set any value for `description` on any instance of the resource because you've not included a `description` argument in the block at all. Therefore the provider ought to have returned a plan with that argument still set to null, but it's instead reported that it's planning to set it to `\"Install complete\"`, which is for this combination of schema and configuration.\n\nThere is one narrow situation where the provider _should_ be allowed to return `\"Install complete\"` as its planned value for this argument: if the object already existed in the prior state and the prior state value was already set to `\"Install complete\"`. In the provider plugin protocol, echoing back the value from the prior state instead of the value from the configuration is how a provider tells OpenTofu \"the new value is semantically equivalent to the previous value, so we'll retain the previous value\". That's intended for situations like, for example, an attribute that takes a JSON string where the whitespace between the tokens in that string is not part of the meaning and so changes only to the whitespace should not require an update. If you believe that this exception should apply in your case then I think the best next step would be to review the debug/trace log to understand better what happened here.\n\nIf that exception does not apply in your case then I'd suggest to report this bug in [the provider's own repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-helm) as the error message suggests, since the fix for this error would need to be implemented in that codebase.\n\nThanks again!\n",

The error I get upon running a 'tofu plan' is:\n\nPlanning failed. OpenTofu encountered an error while generating this plan.\n\n│ Error: Provider produced invalid plan\n│ \n│ Provider \"provider[\\\"registry.opentofu.org/hashicorp/helm\\\"].by_region[\\\"us-ashburn-1\\\"]\" planned an invalid value for\n│ helm_release.ingress-nginx[\"us-ashburn-1\"].description: planned value cty.StringVal(\"Install complete\") for a non-computed\n│ attribute.\n│ \n│ This is a bug in the provider, which should be reported in the provider's own issue tracker.\n╵\n\n\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1: 'tofu init'\n2: 'tofu plan'\n\n### Additional Context\n\nFor this code, I'm pulling in data from an existing Oracle OCI VCN and an existing OKE Kubernetes cluster. I have a for_each loop for the provider that iterates through a map to figure out what regions it should be looking for, although currently it's only a single region. This all works fine, and the helm chart installation works fine. I only get the error if I try to add the looped (for_each) import statement to my code for the helm chart.\n\n### References\n\n_No response_",

Since main.go was quite overcrowded\nwith various different concerns, the handling of those environment\nvariables also moves into the new arguments.go file here, since the two\nshare an upstream dependency and both involve simplistic substitutions and\ninsertions into the argument vector.

This means that tool makers need to manually create structure definitions.\n\n### Attempted Solutions\n\nhttps://github.com/opentofu/tofu-exec\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe OpenTofu project should publish [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) documents for the JSON output, which will enable code generation for tools interacting with OpenTofu in any language. We should also create automated tests that validate the output against the schema, making sure that the schema is accurate.\n\n### References\n\n- #2455\n- #1051\n- #810\n- #758\n- #544\n",

        "body": "### OpenTofu Version\n\n```shell\nNo version as this does not exist.\n```\n\n\n### The problem in your OpenTofu project\n\nNo problem with OpenTofu directly, but instead a request for the ability to interact directly with providers be provided via the `tofu` CLI (or a separate CLI).  The idea would be to provide a CLI which you can communicate with via a protocol other than gRPC.  Most likely JSON.  The reason for this request is:\r\n\r\n1. Tofu allowing directly interacting with a provider via a simpler protocol than gRPC allows for more usecases and integrating tofu/those providers into other projects that want to manage cloud resources.  It provides a re-usable interface, via tofu, into the existing ecosystem by a mechanism other than HCL.\r\n2. Using a protocol other than gRPC opens up a lot of other ways to interact with those providers giving more people the ability to do things.  While not a maxima in any way, being able to interact with a system via the CLI with `jq` is unreasonably effective in accomplishing a lot of tasks.\r\n3. I, personally, would like this functionality for a few reasons 1) I would like to be able to easily test providers via testing frameworks I have in other languages.  Specifically doing property based testing via Python would be cool (hypothesis), as well as other tooling and being forced to integrate with Go to accomplish that is just a bit more friction than it should be (IMHO).  2) I want to experiment with integrating against providers to do some management of resources outside of HCL.\n\n### Attempted Solutions\n\nI have looked at doing this myself but I simply do not know enough about how Tofu works to accomplish this task.\n\n### Proposal\n\nSpecific proposal is an additional sub-command to the `tofu` CLI that specifies a provider (including version constraint) and performs the machinery to download it and execute it.  The `tofu` command stays open and allows interacting with the provider via a JSON interface via stdin and stdout.  This protocol would support:\r\n\r\n1. Querying the provider its schema or whatever information is necessary to interact with it correctly.\r\n2. Sending any state information to the provider.\r\n3. Telling the provider to perform an operation (plan, apply, refresh, yadda).\r\n4. Getting any operation results from the provider (success, failure, stderr/stdout, etc).\r\n\r\nAnd there are probably other operations that should be available that I do not know due to ignorance.\r\n\r\nI think this would be valuable for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1. As mentioned above, it allows more people to interact with the provider ecosystem, who knows what value would come out of that?\r\n2. While HCL is already the de facto standard in IaC and cloud configuration.  I believe that the future will probably be experimenting in new user interface (languages, UIs, etc), but the provider ecosystem is so valuable that these future innovations will want to use that.  This would allow tofu to be the core underpinning all of that innovation.\n\n### References\n\n_No response_",

Understanding the inner workings of OpenTofu, particularly when it comes to performance bottlenecks can be an extremely overwhelming task. There are many factors involved that can cause tofu to appear to be slower than expected and the purpose of this RFC is to provide end-users with a tool which they can use to begin pinpointing the cause of such issues much easier.\n+\n+This RFC proposes enhancing OpenTofu’s support for OpenTelemetry to provide end-users with a clear, high-level view of where time is spent during different phases of an OpenTofu run. By integrating tracing capabilities, users will gain visibility into the processes behind their runs without needing to wade through extensive debug logs or intricate traces. This should empower users to answer critical questions such as:\n+- How much time is spent refreshing each resource?\n+- Why does it take so long before applying changes?\n+- Which steps are the most time-consuming during the initialization phase?\n+\n+By offering this window into OpenTofu’s internals, we aim to enable users to make more informed decisions, optimize their workflows, identify regressions and ultimately achieve faster, more predictable outcomes with `tofu`.\n+\n+### Past Discussions\n+\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2028/files - Introduce OpenTelemetry to the OpenTofu codebase [RFC]",

        "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nAfter reading the specification, I have a few notes, ideas, and questions:\r\n\r\n* The specification discusses adding OpenTelemetry spans but does not clarify how end users or operators can configure the OTEL exporter (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin, or OTLP), set endpoints, or choose sampling rates. It is also unclear whether OpenTofu will silently ignore a malformed `TRACEPARENT`, throw an error, or log a warning?\r\n* There is no mention of how users can opt out of or selectively enable/disable tracing features—whether this would be through an environment variable, a CLI flag, or another mechanism.  \r\n* The document describes major entry points (e.g., initialization, graph construction, and resource refreshing) but does not define how spans will be consistently named or how parent-child relationships will be established. It only includes generic attributes without specifying naming conventions.  \r\n* RFC focuses almost exclusively on tracing via OpenTelemetry and does not address metrics (such as download time, error count, or cache size). Will these metrics be covered in a separate specification?\r\n\r\n(although these aspects may remain purely implementation details rather than part of the specification)\r\n",

        "body": "### OpenTofu Version\n\n```shell\nOpenTofu v1.9.0\non darwin_arm64\n```\n\n### The problem in your OpenTofu project\n\nWhen using `data` resources to query for **optional** inputs, e.g.: to inject metadata for computing resource labels, it can create a risk of failure and bottleneck if the underlying API the provider uses is not reachable.\n\n*This is a real world example from the [Backstage Provider](https://github.com/datolabs-io/terraform-provider-backstage), where we wanted to use it to fetch always up-to-date metadata for labeling from Backstage, but at first could not commit to it because it introduced the risk of an operational bottleneck in case of the Backstage API being down. Deployments would grind to a halt and fail because Backstage is down.*\n\n### Attempted Solutions\n\nA localized solution we came up with was to contact the maintainer of the provider and [implement a fallback mechanism](https://github.com/datolabs-io/terraform-provider-backstage/pull/167) that allowed passing in an object matching the expected output. The passed in fallback input, if provided, was then used after a set number of retries and simply returned to the consumer instead of an error.\n\nTo make this really useful we used the [built-in remote state data source](https://opentofu.org/docs/language/state/remote-state-data/) to get the last successful \"snapshot\" of the latest apply and used that as the fallback input.\n\nAs a result we were able to use Backstage as the defacto source of truth for metadata computing always up-to-date labels, causing no drift or failed deployments even if Backstage was to go down.\n\n### Proposal\n\nI think a generalized fallback mechanism for `data sources` to automatically use the last successful snapshot of the configured state backend would be a great and distinguishing feature addition to OpenTofu making it possible to use the above described pattern in any provider without having to \"patch\" it.\n\nOne way I could think of that is is implemented is using the `lifecycle` meta argument of `data sources` and, in its simplest version, add a `fallback_from_state = true/false` option.\nSet to `true` a not reachable or timeout error of the provider will cause the data source to print a warning with the returned error instead and returns the last snapshot from the state.\n\nIf no data exists in the state the error is passed through as an error and fails like usual.\n\n```hcl\ndata \"aws_ami\" \"example\" {\n  id = var.aws_ami_id\n\n  lifecycle {\n    fallback_from_state = true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n*Note: in addition to this a retry, backoff, and resiliency feature for providers in general could also be added to increase the reliability of pipelines and decrease failure rates due to timeouts or throttling.*\n\n### References\n\n- [Blog post about the topic: Fixing Cloud Resource Labeling: Using Backstage Metadata with Terraform](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fixing-cloud-resource-labeling-using-backstage-michael-reichenbach-fviof/)",

        "body": "Hi @Silthus! Thanks for opening this issue.\n\nThe OpenTofu Core team periodically discusses new requests with the pending-decision label, but that can take a little time. In the meantime, I'd encourage others who are interested in this request to add 👍 upvotes to the original issue description (_not_ to my comment here) since we use that as a signal for prioritization.\n\n---\n\nOne part of your proposal that is tricky is (emphasis mine):\n\n> Set to true **a not reachable or timeout error of the provider** will cause the data source to print a warning with the returned error instead and returns the last snapshot from the state.\n\nAs previously discussed over in the similar issue https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1760, the provider protocol only differentiates diagnostics by whether they are \"error\" or \"warning\". There is no further machine-readable detail about whether a particular error represents \"timeout\", or \"unreachable\", or any other such fine-grain detail about the cause.\n\nThe OpenTofu project does not currently have any design for how to change or extend the provider protocol, since it's published as part of the plugin framework and that is not an OpenTofu-project-controlled codebase. Therefore any project that would require extending the provider protocol has the very significant prerequisite of designing some way for us to extend the protocol in a way that popular providers would actually use.\n\nWith the protocol as it currently exists, the closest we could get to meeting this proposal would be to \"fallback from state\" on _any error whatsoever_.\n\n---\n\nThere is a second part of the proposal that is challenging for a different reason.\n\nAlthough OpenTofu _does_ track the most recently read data from a data source in state snapshots, those are included there today primarily as a concession to debugging and inspection. For example, it allows using `tofu console` or `tofu show` to inspect the data source results, since those commands work _exclusively_ with the latest state snapshot.\n\nHowever, in a normal plan/apply round OpenTofu must currently always discard any prior state for a data resource because the protocol has no data source equivalent of [the `UpgradeResourceState` function](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/blob/main/docs/resource-instance-change-lifecycle.md#upgraderesourcestate). The data in the prior state might therefore have been written by an earlier version of the provider with an incompatible schema, and there is no means for OpenTofu to \"fix\" that by asking the provider to upgrade it to the latest schema as we normally would for managed resources.\n\nIn the case of `tofu console` today, if you upgrade to a newer version of a provider with an incompatible data source schema and then try to evaluate an expression involving that data source you will encounter a state decoding error. Although that certainly isn't ideal, we accept it as a compromise because `tofu console` is an occasionally-used debugging tool rather than part of the primary workflow.\n\nYour proposal would effectively cause the same situation to arise as part of the main plan/apply workflow, and so we'd need to define what ought to happen if the provider's `ReadDataSource` function returns an error _and_ the prior state contains data that doesn't conform to the current provider schema.\n\nSince currently this problem only arises for rarely-used debugging commands rather than the primary workflow, I can't say how commonly these situations would occur. Provider developers are accustomed to being able to change the schema for data sources with no significant consequences because today's OpenTofu _always_ requests a fresh result on each plan, and so I would expect that this problem would arise more often than we'd like. It could potentially arise after any change in the selected version of a provider.\n\n(Again, since we don't currently have any way to extend the provider protocol we also cannot add a data source equivalent of `UpgradeResourceState`.)\n\n---\n\nI don't mean either of the above as saying that we definitely can't or shouldn't do something like what this proposal suggests. I mean only that if this proposal is accepted then there will be some more technical design questions to answer before it would be complete enough to implement.\n\nThanks again!\n",

Thank you for trying that!\n\nBefore trying anything else I'd like to try to understand why that solution didn't work, since that will hopefully provide a clue as to what we can try next.\n\nWith the explicit, fully-qualified source address in `cdktf.json`, did the generated `cdk.tf.json` change? Specifically, I was hoping that the `required_providers` part would change to appear something like this:\n\n```json\n    \"required_providers\": {\n      \"aws\": {\n        \"source\": \"registry.opentofu.org/hashicorp/aws\",\n        \"version\": \"5.51.1\"\n      }\n    }\n```\n\nDoes the generated `source` address now match the fully-qualified source address you added in `cdktf.json`?\n",

Understanding the inner workings of OpenTofu, particularly when it comes to performance bottlenecks can be an extremely overwhelming task. There are many factors involved that can cause tofu to appear to be slower than expected and the purpose of this RFC is to provide end-users with a tool which they can use to begin pinpointing the cause of such issues much easier.\n+\n+This RFC proposes enhancing OpenTofu’s support for OpenTelemetry to provide end-users with a clear, high-level view of where time is spent during different phases of an OpenTofu run. By integrating tracing capabilities, users will gain visibility into the processes behind their runs without needing to wade through extensive debug logs or intricate traces. This should empower users to answer critical questions such as:\n+- How much time is spent refreshing each resource?\n+- Why does it take so long before applying changes?\n+- Which steps are the most time-consuming during the initialization phase?\n+\n+By offering this window into OpenTofu’s internals, we aim to enable users to make more informed decisions, optimize their workflows, identify regressions and ultimately achieve faster, more predictable outcomes with `tofu`.\n+\n+### Past Discussions\n+\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2028/files - Introduce OpenTelemetry to the OpenTofu codebase [RFC]\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1519 - OpenTelemetry Support\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/1517 - A draft PR that added OpenTelemetry support to the planning process in OpenTofu as a proof of concept.\n+\n+https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/debugging/#opentelemetry-integration - Terragrunt has a similar implementation of OpenTelemetry that we could use as a reference.  I also think that it would be amazing to enable the tracing and get traces for both Terragrunt and OpenTofu collected all at once so you have full visibility end to end as to what is happening.\n+\n+## Approach\n+To provide users with actionable insights into the performance of their runs, I propose adding traces to the major entrypoints into the system. Instead of overwhelming the end users with granular details from lower-level operations, the tracing here will focus on key stages of the workflow. These stages should align with the user-facing concepts of `tofu` and add additional context to the already existing logs, allowing people to easily understand where time is spent without requiring deep technical knowledge of the inner-workings of opentofu.\n+\n+As it is almost impossible to estimate every flow through the application, I propose that we take an iterative approach to adding spans. Targetting what we know is used often first and then expanding on that over time.\n+\n+### Tracing Flow for Plan + Apply\n+Below is the proposed flow of traces for a typical `plan` + `apply` operation, with key entrypoints highlighted for the end users.\n+\n+- **Initialization**\n+    - **Parsing Configuration**: Trace the time spent parsing the configuration files to build the initial representation of infrastructure.\n+    - **Checking/Validating Providers**: Ensure that providers are downloaded already or not.\n+    - **Downloading Providers**: Trace the time taken to both download and validate the checksum of the providers that are downloaded.\n+- **Schema Fetching and Validation**\n+    - **Fetching Provider Schemas**: Trace the time spent fetching and validating schemas from providers, especially for dynamic configurations, or for validating provider-defined function calls.\n+- **Graph Construction**\n+    - **Total Time**: Trace the time taken to construct the graph\n+- **Refreshing Resources**\n+    - **Time Per Item**: Trace the time taken to talk to the provider to refresh each resource states or fetch each data source\n+- **Change Determination**\n+    - **Time Per Item**: Time taken to determine what changes need to happen and how for each item in the graph (resources, data sources etc)\n+- **Apply Phase**\n+    - **Applying Changes**: Provide high-level traces for each entity’s apply item, indicating time taken and success/failure per item.\n+\n+### Other Common Traceable Events\n+Alongside the actual flow of `tofu` and its execution, I propose that we also trace common events in the system such as communication with backends, time taken to handle state encryption, time taken to read/write files to/from disk.\n+\n+### ### Key Benefits of This Approach\n+\n+- **Actionable**: Users can immediately identify where time is being spent (e.g., slow resource refreshes or downloads).\n+- **High-Level Insights**: The tracing flow aligns with user-visible operations, avoiding confusion from lower-level details.\n+- **Complementary**: Tracing works alongside logs, adding timing and context without replacing existing diagnostic tools.\n+\n+### OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions\n+To adhere to existing standards and tooling out there, we should adopt some of the commonly used conventions for our telemetry.\n+#### **General Conventions**\n+I propose that we should adopt the general conventions defined by OpenTelemetry [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/5b24784e032ada99312d5a17d6970da434f5ce88/docs/README.md) to describe spans and resources. These conventions ensure that traces are self-explanatory and align with tools like Jaeger, and Grafana.\n+\n+The list below is not exhaustive and is intended to show that there is a lot of ways that we can introduce great tracing to integrate with other tooling and provide a lot of information.\n+\n+**Generic Attributes**:\n+- **`process.command_line`**: Command-line arguments used in the run.\n+    - Example: `\"tofu plan -var-file=vars.tfvars\"`\n+- **`file.path`**: Path of HCL files being parsed.\n+    - Example: `\"/my-infra/main.tf\"`\n+- **`service.name`**: The logical service name.\n+    - Example: `opentofu`\n+- **`service.version`**: The version of OpenTofu.\n+    - Example: `1.10.0`\n+- **`process.runtime.name`**, **`process.runtime.version`**, **`process.runtime.description`**: Details about the runtime (e.g., Go version).\n+\n+**Semantic Conventions**\n+- **`trace.span_kind`**: Specify the role of the span in the operation.\n+    - `SPAN_KIND_SERVER`: Entry points like `tofu plan` or `tofu apply`.\n+    - `SPAN_KIND_CLIENT`: Calls to providers or APIs (e.g., fetching provider schemas, refreshing states).\n+- **`trace.parent_id`**: Links child spans to their parent spans for hierarchy.\n+\n+## OpenTofu as a cog in the machine\n+\n+In the context of OpenTofu's integration with OpenTelemetry, it's essential to consider how trace context is propagated **from** external systems like CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Spacelift, Jenkins) or tools like Terragrunt **into** OpenTofu. This ensures that traces remain connected across the entire workflow, providing end-to-end observability.\n+\n+**Environment Variable Trace Context Propagation:**\n+The OpenTelemetry Enhancement Proposal [OTEP #258](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/pull/258) introduces a standardized method for context propagation using environment variables. This approach is particularly beneficial for CI/CD systems and other tools that execute OpenTofu as a subprocess, where traditional context propagation methods (like HTTP headers) aren't applicable.\n+\n+**Implementation in OpenTofu:**\n+1. **Reading Trace Context from Environment Variables:**\n+    - When OpenTofu starts, it should check for specific environment variables that carry trace context, as defined by OTEP #258.\n+    - The primary environment variable for trace context is `TRACEPARENT`, which contains the trace context in a standardized format.\n+2. **Injecting Trace Context into OpenTofu:**\n+    - If the `TRACEPARENT` environment variable is present, OpenTofu should extract the trace context from it.\n+    - OpenTofu can then continue the trace, creating spans that are linked to the originating trace from the CI/CD system or external tool.\n+3. **Propagating Trace Context to Provider Plugins [ Future Extension ]:**\n+    - As OpenTofu interacts with provider plugins, it should propagate the trace context to these plugins.\n+    - This ensures that the entire operation, from the CI/CD system through OpenTofu and down to the provider plugins, is part of a single, cohesive trace.\n+\n+## Benefits:\n+- **End-to-End Observability:** By adopting environment variable-based context propagation, OpenTofu can participate in distributed traces initiated by external systems, providing a complete view of the infrastructure provisioning process.\n+- **Standardization:** Aligning with OTEP #258 ensures compatibility with other tools and systems that follow the same standard, promoting interoperability.\n+- **Ease of Implementation:** Using environment variables for context propagation is straightforward and doesn't require significant changes to existing workflows, making it an efficient solution for integrating tracing across diverse systems.\n+\n+## Possible Future Expansions\n+\n+- **Tracing each and every call to providers**: This could be helpful for provider authors, or people who wish to understand more about what is happening. This would be easy to add but could easily add too much clutter. We should evaluate during development how informative these traces are.\n+- **Expanding Trace Context to the Provider**: For our gRPC calls to the providers, we could send the `TRACEPARENT`  through to the provider. Then if a provider author wishes to provide OTEL tracing, they can do and have the full context of what is ongoing. This would be helpful but it is not needed right now due to no providers supporting this.",

Understanding the inner workings of OpenTofu, particularly when it comes to performance bottlenecks can be an extremely overwhelming task. There are many factors involved that can cause tofu to appear to be slower than expected and the purpose of this RFC is to provide end-users with a tool which they can use to begin pinpointing the cause of such issues much easier.\n+\n+This RFC proposes enhancing OpenTofu’s support for OpenTelemetry to provide end-users with a clear, high-level view of where time is spent during different phases of an OpenTofu run. By integrating tracing capabilities, users will gain visibility into the processes behind their runs without needing to wade through extensive debug logs or intricate traces. This should empower users to answer critical questions such as:\n+- How much time is spent refreshing each resource?\n+- Why does it take so long before applying changes?\n+- Which steps are the most time-consuming during the initialization phase?\n+\n+By offering this window into OpenTofu’s internals, we aim to enable users to make more informed decisions, optimize their workflows, identify regressions and ultimately achieve faster, more predictable outcomes with `tofu`.\n+\n+### Past Discussions\n+\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2028/files - Introduce OpenTelemetry to the OpenTofu codebase [RFC]\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1519 - OpenTelemetry Support\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/1517 - A draft PR that added OpenTelemetry support to the planning process in OpenTofu as a proof of concept.\n+\n+https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/debugging/#opentelemetry-integration - Terragrunt has a similar implementation of OpenTelemetry that we could use as a reference.  I also think that it would be amazing to enable the tracing and get traces for both Terragrunt and OpenTofu collected all at once so you have full visibility end to end as to what is happening.",

Understanding the inner workings of OpenTofu, particularly when it comes to performance bottlenecks can be an extremely overwhelming task. There are many factors involved that can cause tofu to appear to be slower than expected and the purpose of this RFC is to provide end-users with a tool which they can use to begin pinpointing the cause of such issues much easier.\n+\n+This RFC proposes enhancing OpenTofu’s support for OpenTelemetry to provide end-users with a clear, high-level view of where time is spent during different phases of an OpenTofu run. By integrating tracing capabilities, users will gain visibility into the processes behind their runs without needing to wade through extensive debug logs or intricate traces. This should empower users to answer critical questions such as:\n+- How much time is spent refreshing each resource?\n+- Why does it take so long before applying changes?\n+- Which steps are the most time-consuming during the initialization phase?\n+\n+By offering this window into OpenTofu’s internals, we aim to enable users to make more informed decisions, optimize their workflows, identify regressions and ultimately achieve faster, more predictable outcomes with `tofu`.\n+\n+### Past Discussions\n+\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2028/files - Introduce OpenTelemetry to the OpenTofu codebase [RFC]\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1519 - OpenTelemetry Support\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/1517 - A draft PR that added OpenTelemetry support to the planning process in OpenTofu as a proof of concept.\n+\n+https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/debugging/#opentelemetry-integration - Terragrunt has a similar implementation of OpenTelemetry that we could use as a reference.  I also think that it would be amazing to enable the tracing and get traces for both Terragrunt and OpenTofu collected all at once so you have full visibility end to end as to what is happening.\n+\n+## Approach\n+To provide users with actionable insights into the performance of their runs, I propose adding traces to the major entrypoints into the system. Instead of overwhelming the end users with granular details from lower-level operations, the tracing here will focus on key stages of the workflow. These stages should align with the user-facing concepts of `tofu` and add additional context to the already existing logs, allowing people to easily understand where time is spent without requiring deep technical knowledge of the inner-workings of opentofu.\n+\n+As it is almost impossible to estimate every flow through the application, I propose that we take an iterative approach to adding spans. Targetting what we know is used often first and then expanding on that over time.\n+\n+### Tracing Flow for Plan + Apply\n+Below is the proposed flow of traces for a typical `plan` + `apply` operation, with key entrypoints highlighted for the end users.\n+\n+- **Initialization**\n+    - **Parsing Configuration**: Trace the time spent parsing the configuration files to build the initial representation of infrastructure.\n+    - **Checking/Validating Providers**: Ensure that providers are downloaded already or not.\n+    - **Downloading Providers**: Trace the time taken to both download and validate the checksum of the providers that are downloaded.\n+- **Schema Fetching and Validation**\n+    - **Fetching Provider Schemas**: Trace the time spent fetching and validating schemas from providers, especially for dynamic configurations, or for validating provider-defined function calls.\n+- **Graph Construction**\n+    - **Total Time**: Trace the time taken to construct the graph\n+- **Refreshing Resources**\n+    - **Time Per Item**: Trace the time taken to talk to the provider to refresh each resource states or fetch each data source\n+- **Change Determination**\n+    - **Time Per Item**: Time taken to determine what changes need to happen and how for each item in the graph (resources, data sources etc)",

Understanding the inner workings of OpenTofu, particularly when it comes to performance bottlenecks can be an extremely overwhelming task. There are many factors involved that can cause tofu to appear to be slower than expected and the purpose of this RFC is to provide end-users with a tool which they can use to begin pinpointing the cause of such issues much easier.\n+\n+This RFC proposes enhancing OpenTofu’s support for OpenTelemetry to provide end-users with a clear, high-level view of where time is spent during different phases of an OpenTofu run. By integrating tracing capabilities, users will gain visibility into the processes behind their runs without needing to wade through extensive debug logs or intricate traces. This should empower users to answer critical questions such as:\n+- How much time is spent refreshing each resource?\n+- Why does it take so long before applying changes?\n+- Which steps are the most time-consuming during the initialization phase?\n+\n+By offering this window into OpenTofu’s internals, we aim to enable users to make more informed decisions, optimize their workflows, identify regressions and ultimately achieve faster, more predictable outcomes with `tofu`.\n+\n+### Past Discussions\n+\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2028/files - Introduce OpenTelemetry to the OpenTofu codebase [RFC]\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1519 - OpenTelemetry Support\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/1517 - A draft PR that added OpenTelemetry support to the planning process in OpenTofu as a proof of concept.\n+\n+https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/debugging/#opentelemetry-integration - Terragrunt has a similar implementation of OpenTelemetry that we could use as a reference.  I also think that it would be amazing to enable the tracing and get traces for both Terragrunt and OpenTofu collected all at once so you have full visibility end to end as to what is happening.\n+\n+## Approach\n+To provide users with actionable insights into the performance of their runs, I propose adding traces to the major entrypoints into the system. Instead of overwhelming the end users with granular details from lower-level operations, the tracing here will focus on key stages of the workflow. These stages should align with the user-facing concepts of `tofu` and add additional context to the already existing logs, allowing people to easily understand where time is spent without requiring deep technical knowledge of the inner-workings of opentofu.\n+\n+As it is almost impossible to estimate every flow through the application, I propose that we take an iterative approach to adding spans. Targetting what we know is used often first and then expanding on that over time.\n+\n+### Tracing Flow for Plan + Apply\n+Below is the proposed flow of traces for a typical `plan` + `apply` operation, with key entrypoints highlighted for the end users.\n+\n+- **Initialization**\n+    - **Parsing Configuration**: Trace the time spent parsing the configuration files to build the initial representation of infrastructure.\n+    - **Checking/Validating Providers**: Ensure that providers are downloaded already or not.\n+    - **Downloading Providers**: Trace the time taken to both download and validate the checksum of the providers that are downloaded.\n+- **Schema Fetching and Validation**\n+    - **Fetching Provider Schemas**: Trace the time spent fetching and validating schemas from providers, especially for dynamic configurations, or for validating provider-defined function calls.\n+- **Graph Construction**\n+    - **Total Time**: Trace the time taken to construct the graph\n+- **Refreshing Resources**\n+    - **Time Per Item**: Trace the time taken to talk to the provider to refresh each resource states or fetch each data source\n+- **Change Determination**\n+    - **Time Per Item**: Time taken to determine what changes need to happen and how for each item in the graph (resources, data sources etc)\n+- **Apply Phase**\n+    - **Applying Changes**: Provide high-level traces for each entity’s apply item, indicating time taken and success/failure per item.\n+\n+### Other Common Traceable Events\n+Alongside the actual flow of `tofu` and its execution, I propose that we also trace common events in the system such as communication with backends, time taken to handle state encryption, time taken to read/write files to/from disk.\n+\n+### ### Key Benefits of This Approach\n+\n+- **Actionable**: Users can immediately identify where time is being spent (e.g., slow resource refreshes or downloads).\n+- **High-Level Insights**: The tracing flow aligns with user-visible operations, avoiding confusion from lower-level details.\n+- **Complementary**: Tracing works alongside logs, adding timing and context without replacing existing diagnostic tools.\n+\n+### OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions\n+To adhere to existing standards and tooling out there, we should adopt some of the commonly used conventions for our telemetry.\n+#### **General Conventions**\n+I propose that we should adopt the general conventions defined by OpenTelemetry [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/5b24784e032ada99312d5a17d6970da434f5ce88/docs/README.md) to describe spans and resources. These conventions ensure that traces are self-explanatory and align with tools like Jaeger, and Grafana.\n+\n+The list below is not exhaustive and is intended to show that there is a lot of ways that we can introduce great tracing to integrate with other tooling and provide a lot of information.\n+\n+**Generic Attributes**:\n+- **`process.command_line`**: Command-line arguments used in the run.\n+    - Example: `\"tofu plan -var-file=vars.tfvars\"`\n+- **`file.path`**: Path of HCL files being parsed.\n+    - Example: `\"/my-infra/main.tf\"`\n+- **`service.name`**: The logical service name.\n+    - Example: `opentofu`\n+- **`service.version`**: The version of OpenTofu.\n+    - Example: `1.10.0`\n+- **`process.runtime.name`**, **`process.runtime.version`**, **`process.runtime.description`**: Details about the runtime (e.g., Go version).\n+\n+**Semantic Conventions**\n+- **`trace.span_kind`**: Specify the role of the span in the operation.\n+    - `SPAN_KIND_SERVER`: Entry points like `tofu plan` or `tofu apply`.\n+    - `SPAN_KIND_CLIENT`: Calls to providers or APIs (e.g., fetching provider schemas, refreshing states).\n+- **`trace.parent_id`**: Links child spans to their parent spans for hierarchy.\n+\n+## OpenTofu as a cog in the machine\n+\n+In the context of OpenTofu's integration with OpenTelemetry, it's essential to consider how trace context is propagated **from** external systems like CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Spacelift, Jenkins) or tools like Terragrunt **into** OpenTofu. This ensures that traces remain connected across the entire workflow, providing end-to-end observability.\n+\n+**Environment Variable Trace Context Propagation:**\n+The OpenTelemetry Enhancement Proposal [OTEP #258](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/pull/258) introduces a standardized method for context propagation using environment variables. This approach is particularly beneficial for CI/CD systems and other tools that execute OpenTofu as a subprocess, where traditional context propagation methods (like HTTP headers) aren't applicable.\n+\n+**Implementation in OpenTofu:**\n+1. **Reading Trace Context from Environment Variables:**\n+    - When OpenTofu starts, it should check for specific environment variables that carry trace context, as defined by OTEP #258.\n+    - The primary environment variable for trace context is `TRACEPARENT`, which contains the trace context in a standardized format.\n+2. **Injecting Trace Context into OpenTofu:**\n+    - If the `TRACEPARENT` environment variable is present, OpenTofu should extract the trace context from it.\n+    - OpenTofu can then continue the trace, creating spans that are linked to the originating trace from the CI/CD system or external tool.\n+3. **Propagating Trace Context to Provider Plugins [ Future Extension ]:**\n+    - As OpenTofu interacts with provider plugins, it should propagate the trace context to these plugins.\n+    - This ensures that the entire operation, from the CI/CD system through OpenTofu and down to the provider plugins, is part of a single, cohesive trace.\n+\n+## Benefits:\n+- **End-to-End Observability:** By adopting environment variable-based context propagation, OpenTofu can participate in distributed traces initiated by external systems, providing a complete view of the infrastructure provisioning process.\n+- **Standardization:** Aligning with OTEP #258 ensures compatibility with other tools and systems that follow the same standard, promoting interoperability.\n+- **Ease of Implementation:** Using environment variables for context propagation is straightforward and doesn't require significant changes to existing workflows, making it an efficient solution for integrating tracing across diverse systems.\n+\n+## Possible Future Expansions\n+\n+- **Tracing each and every call to providers**: This could be helpful for provider authors, or people who wish to understand more about what is happening. This would be easy to add but could easily add too much clutter. We should evaluate during development how informative these traces are.\n+- **Expanding Trace Context to the Provider**: For our gRPC calls to the providers, we could send the `TRACEPARENT`  through to the provider. Then if a provider author wishes to provide OTEL tracing, they can do and have the full context of what is ongoing. This would be helpful but it is not needed right now due to no providers supporting this.",

Understanding the inner workings of OpenTofu, particularly when it comes to performance bottlenecks can be an extremely overwhelming task. There are many factors involved that can cause tofu to appear to be slower than expected and the purpose of this RFC is to provide end-users with a tool which they can use to begin pinpointing the cause of such issues much easier.\n+\n+This RFC proposes enhancing OpenTofu’s support for OpenTelemetry to provide end-users with a clear, high-level view of where time is spent during different phases of an OpenTofu run. By integrating tracing capabilities, users will gain visibility into the processes behind their runs without needing to wade through extensive debug logs or intricate traces. This should empower users to answer critical questions such as:\n+- How much time is spent refreshing each resource?\n+- Why does it take so long before applying changes?\n+- Which steps are the most time-consuming during the initialization phase?\n+\n+By offering this window into OpenTofu’s internals, we aim to enable users to make more informed decisions, optimize their workflows, identify regressions and ultimately achieve faster, more predictable outcomes with `tofu`.\n+\n+### Past Discussions\n+\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/2028/files - Introduce OpenTelemetry to the OpenTofu codebase [RFC]\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/1519 - OpenTelemetry Support\n+https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/pull/1517 - A draft PR that added OpenTelemetry support to the planning process in OpenTofu as a proof of concept.\n+\n+https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/docs/features/debugging/#opentelemetry-integration - Terragrunt has a similar implementation of OpenTelemetry that we could use as a reference.  I also think that it would be amazing to enable the tracing and get traces for both Terragrunt and OpenTofu collected all at once so you have full visibility end to end as to what is happening.",

        "body": "I recently went through the effort of [retooling tofu-exec](https://github.com/opentofu/tofu-exec/pull/7) for OpenTofu and the changeset is rather large. My experience with this codebase is that it is a lot of code to maintain for something that very few people would be using. (It is currently all but unusable.)\n\nWe could go and have this be an exclusively community-maintained repository, but I believe, the community would be better served if we created JSON schema documents for the JSON output so that users of other programming languages also benefit from a unified interface. Therefore, I would like to propose that **the [`tofu-exec` repository](https://github.com/opentofu/tofu-exec) should be archived** with a note that people should be using [TofuDL](https://github.com/opentofu/tofudl) to obtain a `tofu` binary and use the JSON output directly instead of a Go wrapper. If accepted, I would open separate issue(s) for creating JSON schema documents.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **This issue will be proposed to the TSC on or after February 15, 2025, please leave your input here until that time, detailing what benefit you get from `tofu-exec` or `terraform-exec` in relation to OpenTofu over just using `TofuDL` with an exec.**",

        "body": "@abstractionfactory understandable decision and I think you addressed one main point, namely JSON schemas.\n\nWe are currently working on a CLI to make the import of existing infrastructure setups easier for our customers (https://github.com/SAP/terraform-exporter-btp). In this CLI we leverage the `tfexec` functionality. However the only reason for using `tfexec` is that this way we get back the Terraform state in a typed way and can process the contained information easier i.e., with less overhead on our end. As we want to support OpenTofu we have been looking for an comparable option at OpenTofu.\nHence, if OpenTofu could provide e.g.,  a JSON schema for the state (which should be compatible as a dropIn replacement for Terraform) this would be great and address the main reason why we used `tfexec` and would make our life easier  ",

        "body": "### OpenTofu Version\n\n```shell\nOpenTofu v1.9.0\non linux_amd64\n```\n\n### The problem in your OpenTofu project\n\nAs a user, I'd like to be able to easily generate `-target` and / or `-exclude` params for multiple resources. It is easy to generate a list of such resources but not so easy to pass them to command line due to various reasons (escaping, cmdline length limits, etc).\n\n\n### Attempted Solutions\n\nVarious shell in-liners. It's always messy and rather unpleasant to debug.\n\n### Proposal\n\nI'd like to propose a command line argument `-options-file=<filename>` which will read additional command line arguments from a file, such as:\n```\n-var foo=bar\n-include 'dummy_resource.name[\"key\"]'\n...\n```\n\nAlternatively, for my use case an alternative syntax for `-target` and `-exclude`:\n```\ntofu plan -target @filename\n```\nwhere `<filename>` contains just a list of resources, one per line. \n\nAlternatively, instead of `@<filename>` a new argument, such as `-target-file` and `-exclude-file` could be implemented to work same as `-var-file` works now.\n\nThe `-options-file` argument seems like the most flexible, especially if it could be specified multiple times and had a `TOFU_OPTIONS_FILE_*` env var(s) counterpart as it would solve not just my use case but allow for other use cases such as specific per-project command line arguments.\n\nOn the other hand, having both `-[target|exclude]-file` and `-options-file` arguments probably wouldn't hurt either :)\n\n### References\n\nThere's another [issue](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/2307) where the same idea was [mentioned](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/2307#issuecomment-2555663380). The issue itself tries to solve a different problem though and if `-target-file` argument was used, it would directly compete with that issue - imo `-target-file`, if it was implemented, should behave like described in this issue as it is more consistent with already existing `-var-file` argument.",

That would allow to test the module with different regions for a provider, for example\r\nAnother example is referring to run outputs - Running some setup configuration, which might get some secret AWS credentials, and then you could initialize the provider with these credentials\r\n\r\n\n\n### Attempted Solutions\n\nCurrently that's not possible, and the provider configuration in test suites is pretty static\n\n### Proposal\n\nAllow `provider` blocks in test files to refer to variables defined in the test file, and also allow them to refer to `run` block outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvariables {\r\n  aws_access_key_id = \"aa\"\r\n  aws_secret_access_key = \"bb\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nprovider \"aws\" {\r\n  access_key = var.aws_access_key_id\r\n  secret_key = var.aws_secret_access_key\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand:\r\n```\r\nprovider \"aws\" {\r\n  access_key = run.setup.aws_access_key_id\r\n  secret_key = run.setup.aws_secret_access_key\r\n}\r\n\r\nrun \"setup\" {\r\n  module {\r\n    source = \"./testing/setup\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### References\n\nRelated issue in the Terraform Repository - https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34007",

That would allow to test the module with different regions for a provider, for example\r\nAnother example is referring to run outputs - Running some setup configuration, which might get some secret AWS credentials, and then you could initialize the provider with these credentials\r\n\r\n\n\n### Attempted Solutions\n\nCurrently that's not possible, and the provider configuration in test suites is pretty static\n\n### Proposal\n\nAllow `provider` blocks in test files to refer to variables defined in the test file, and also allow them to refer to `run` block outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvariables {\r\n  aws_access_key_id = \"aa\"\r\n  aws_secret_access_key = \"bb\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nprovider \"aws\" {\r\n  access_key = var.aws_access_key_id\r\n  secret_key = var.aws_secret_access_key\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand:\r\n```\r\nprovider \"aws\" {\r\n  access_key = run.setup.aws_access_key_id\r\n  secret_key = run.setup.aws_secret_access_key\r\n}\r\n\r\nrun \"setup\" {\r\n  module {\r\n    source = \"./testing/setup\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### References\n\nRelated issue in the Terraform Repository - https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34007",

If you follow the steps to reproduce, there there should be no error about undeclared input variables.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\n```\ntests\\ip_assigned.tftest.hcl... fail\n  run \"deploy_network\"... fail\n╷\n│ Error: Reference to undeclared input variable\n│\n│   on tests\\ip_assigned.tftest.hcl line 2, in provider \"openstack\":\n│    2:   auth_url = var.auth_url\n│\n│ An input variable with the name \"auth_url\" has not been declared. This variable can be declared with a variable\n│ \"auth_url\" {} block.\n╵\n╷\n│ Error: Reference to undeclared input variable\n│\n│   on tests\\ip_assigned.tftest.hcl line 3, in provider \"openstack\":\n│    3:   region   = var.region\n│\n│ An input variable with the name \"region\" has not been declared. This variable can be declared with a variable\n│ \"region\" {} block.\n╵\n  run \"deploy_port\"... skip\n```\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Download the following Terraform code  (Or declare a module with variables passed as parameters):\n\n[openstack-instance.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18586527/openstack-instance.zip)\n\n2. Run `tofu init`.\n3. run `tofu test`. They are missing credentials for OpenStack, but should error out first with undefined variables.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_\n\n### References\n\n_No response_",
